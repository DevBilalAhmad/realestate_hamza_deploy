                <p>As the Business Development Manager at Roomflog, my main responsibility is to find the best apartments for our guests. I am focused on discovering hidden gems in the city and transforming them into boutique homes. This involves working closely with property owners, landlords, and real estate agents to source the best properties that match our guest's needs and preferences.
Prior to joining Roomflog, I have always worked in the real estate industry, but always in the startup environment. My most recent role was at Rive, where I led the company's operations in Barcelona.</p>
                <p>I decided to work at Roomflog because I am passionate about what the company does. Roomflog offers a convenient housing solution for those who are new to the city, while providing unique homes that our guests will love. I believe strongly in the work that we do and the team is fantastic to work with.</p>
                <p>The things I enjoy the most include spending quality time with my friends, discovering new restaurants and bars, exploring the city and traveling to new places. Additionally, playing the guitar is one of my greatest passions, and I've been playing it for many years.</p>
                <p>One amusing anecdote is that I co-founded a music group with Albert, who is currently the Sales Manager at Roomflog. This was over a decade ago, and we actually recorded three albums and topped the charts. Nowadays, we still collaborate in the creation of Roomflog's housing symphony.</p>

                <p>I am at Roomflog to lay all the groundwork for a 5 star experience for our guests. My mission is to accompany all our Roomflogs throughout their journey with us and help them with all the needs they may have.</p>
                <p>Before joining the Roomflog team I was taking care of the community of some buildings of the most famous Coworking company on the planet, can you guess which one?</p>
                <p>When I decided to take a new direction in my career, Roomflog crossed the path and for some reason, I felt that this was going to be my new place, a new chapter, new challenges, and growth. This makes me smile. When something gives you a good vibe, you don't know why but you know it's the right path. You have to go for it.</p>
                <p>If I have to describe myself in one sentence, I would say that life is hard but with cheese it's better. You can find me at the cinema, in a museum, in a yoga studio in Barcelona, dancing around or maybe playing Techno on my terrace.</p>
                <p>I could tell you many anecdotes, I think I'm a fun fact myself. Not a week goes by that something strange doesn't happen to me. I can tell you that every time I go camping, whether it's a music festival or spending time in the mountains, I take a bottle of pepper with me :</p>

                <div className='lg:w-[520px] text-xs'>
                <p>As the COO, one of my primary responsibilities is to ensure the smooth and efficient day-to-day operations of the company. I recognize that our success is closely tied to how well we treat our stakeholders, which include landlords, tenants, team members, and partners. To achieve our goal of providing exceptional service, I am dedicated to cultivating strong and positive relationships with each one of these groups.</p>
                <p>Long story short, apart from dabbling in some small entrepreneurship ventures, I spent a good chunk of time working in my family's fashion manufacturing business. My role there involved building and maintaining strong relationships with clients, as well as overseeing the production process in various locations all around the world.</p>
                <p>I've always had this burning desire to create something from scratch that could be helpful to a large audience. Plus, I've always been drawn to the idea of working with smart and talented people in a stimulating environment, where we share a common culture and a fierce determination to make a big impact. Sharing this vision with Carlos while understanding the big opportunity there was in providing a much better housing solution for the expat community looking for temporary stays is what made me dice to jump on this adventure.</p>
